		content: "I got this idea from my son, who is learning web development. I told him that he needs to spend at least as much time coding as learning. Whenever he learns somethign new, he should build something with it. His idea was to create a blog, where he would summarize what he learned.</p>This is a great way to reinforce learning. Not only will he spend time implementing new material, but he will need to reflect on what he has leared. So... I stole his idea. This blog will be where I implement what I learn about JavaScript, React and Meteor. I am creating this, not because we need another wheel reinvented, but to force myself to better learn JavaScript and various frameworks.</p>At this point, I have used create-react-app to create a hello world app, and created a single component to list this blog entries, which are stored in a simple array of objects",

		content: "I'm not a fan of video tutorials, but React for Beginners comes highly recommended. So I bought the basic package from https://reactforbeginners.com/. After a couple hours, I'm starting to get React a bit. I have already covered the main features of ES2015, so I can at least read the code. JSX is weird, but useful as long as you have the right plugins for your text editor.</p> With React, you have to get rid of your concept of MVC, and realize that you are simply makeing components for your app, then rendering them.</p> I also learned that figuring out the JavaScript build tools on your own is a lot of work. Fortunately, we have a Heroku build pack that will easily laaunch your React app on Heroku with zero configuration. You can read about it here: https://blog.heroku.com/deploying-react-with-zero-configuration.</p>Now for more learning, before updating this blog.",

		content: "One of the problems I face in larning a framework in react is my deficient knowledge of JavaScript. I have used JavaScript in the past, but usually just enough JQuery to get by. Now, React introduces me to ES2015, before I truly understand JavaScript. Through the React For Beginners class, I am gaining a better understanding of context binding, and learning a few tricks along the way. Reading about JavaScript binding really made the concept of late binding hit home. I never truly understood the concept until now.",
