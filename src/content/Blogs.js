Whenever he learns somethign new, he should build something with it. His idea was to create a blog, where he would summarize what he learned.</p>This is a great way to reinforce learning. Not only will he spend time implementing new material, but he will need to reflect on what he has leared. So... I stole his idea. This blog will be where I implement what I learn about JavaScript, React and Meteor. I am creating this, not because we need another wheel reinvented, but to force myself to better learn JavaScript and various frameworks.</p>At this point, I have used create-react-app to create a hello world app, and created a single component to list this blog entries, which are stored in a simple array of objects"}
